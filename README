Here are some vhdl files to make a grt_than circuit that compares 2 vectors
of 4 bits. 

The design is based on a sum of products behaviour of a greater than circuit
of 2 bits, and then the instantiation of this circuit and an equal comparator
plus some "glueing" logic gates to make the 4 bits version.

I added the test benches for both designs (the interesting thing).
